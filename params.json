It will be assigned it's own color to make it easy to spot logs from different modules.\r\n- Logging is disabled by default. To enable logging, set `localStorage.debug = true` in your console and refresh the page.\r\n- You can leave the code in in production, and log() will just safely no-op unless localStorage.debug is set.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  //Should be set in your console to see messages\r\n  localStorage.debug = true\r\n  //Configure the max length of module names (optional)\r\n  bows.config({ padLength: 10 })\r\n\r\n  var logger1 = bows('Module 1')\r\n  var logger2 = bows('Module 2')\r\n  var logger3 = bows('Module 3')\r\n\r\n  logger1(\"We started up\")\r\n  logger2(\"We did something too\")\r\n  logger3(\"I'm here\")\r\n  logger3(\"I'm still here\")\r\n  logger2(\"I'm tired\")\r\n  logger1(\"We're done here\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n![Example Output](https://raw.github.com/latentflip/bows/master/example/example.png)\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\n__Status:__ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/latentflip/bows.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/latentflip/bows)\r\n\r\nThis project uses `phantomjs` for tests.
